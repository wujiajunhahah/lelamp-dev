"""Writer-side self-check: backfill summaries + rebuild recent_index.

Contract anchors:

* ``LIFECYCLE.md#\u5bb9\u9519\u4e0e\u6062\u590d`` -- summary backfill is writer-only
* ``LIFECYCLE.md#\u91cd\u5efa\u65f6\u673a`` -- index rebuild happens under flock
  before any new meta.json is written
* ``PROMPT_INTEGRATION.md#Reader \u7684\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\u5951\u7ea6`` -- readers never
  rebuild; all "repair disk" paths live here

The flow at every writer start:

1.  Acquire the global ``.lock``.
2.  Walk ``sessions/*.meta.json``; for each with a missing
    ``summary.json`` whose owning pid is not alive (manual sessions
    always match the "not alive" branch because their pid is
    ``null``), compute + write a summary.
3.  If ``recent_index.json`` is missing, unreadable, or older than
    ``events.jsonl``, rebuild it.
4.  Release the lock.

All steps are idempotent so a writer that crashes halfway through
and restarts simply re-runs the same logic -- no "partially repaired"
state is possible.
